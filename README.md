## Mounting as a Network Drive

This project supports WebDAV, allowing you to mount your R2 buckets as network drives on Windows and macOS. **Note:** Cloudflare Workers cannot run SSH/SFTP servers (they're HTTP-only), but WebDAV provides the same functionality for mounting network drives.

### Windows

1. Open **File Explorer**
2. Right-click **This PC** (or **My Computer**) and select **Map network drive...**
3. Choose a drive letter (e.g., `Z:`)
4. In the **Folder** field, enter your WebDAV URL:
   ```
   https://your-worker.your-subdomain.workers.dev/webdav/your-bucket-name
   ```
5. Check **Connect using different credentials**
6. Click **Finish**
7. Enter your credentials:
   - Username: Your `AUTH_USERNAME`
   - Password: Your `AUTH_PASSWORD`
8. Check **Remember my credentials** if desired
9. Click **OK**

**Alternative (Command Line):**

```cmd
net use Z: https://your-worker.your-subdomain.workers.dev/webdav/your-bucket-name /user:your-username your-password /persistent:yes
```

### macOS

1. Open **Finder**
2. Press `Cmd + K` (or go to **Go** → **Connect to Server...**)
3. Enter your WebDAV URL:
   ```
   https://your-worker.your-subdomain.workers.dev/webdav/your-bucket-name
   ```
4. Click **Connect**
5. When prompted, select **Registered User**
6. Enter your credentials:
   - Username: Your `AUTH_USERNAME`
   - Password: Your `AUTH_PASSWORD`
7. Click **Connect**
8. The drive will appear in Finder's sidebar

**Alternative (Command Line):**

```bash
open "https://your-worker.your-subdomain.workers.dev/webdav/your-bucket-name"
```

### WebDAV Features

The WebDAV implementation supports:

- ✅ **PROPFIND** - Browse directories
- ✅ **GET** - Download files
- ✅ **PUT** - Upload files
- ✅ **DELETE** - Delete files and folders
- ✅ **MKCOL** - Create directories
- ✅ **MOVE** - Rename/move files and folders
- ✅ **COPY** - Copy files and folders
- ✅ **HEAD** - Get file metadata
- ✅ **OPTIONS** - Discover capabilities

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+)
- [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up) with R2 enabled
- [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/)

### Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   > **Note:** In the future, you'll be able to quickly set up a new project using `pnpm dlx cloudflare-nas`. Stay tuned!

2. **Create an R2 bucket** (if you don't have one):

   ```bash
   npx wrangler r2 bucket create my-bucket
   ```

3. **Configure your bucket** in `wrangler.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "r2_buckets": [
       {
         "binding": "my-bucket",
         "bucket_name": "my-bucket"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

4. **Set up D1 database:**

   ```bash
   # Create the D1 database
   npx wrangler d1 create nas-db

   # Update wrangler.json with the database_id from the output above
   # Then run the schema
   npx wrangler d1 execute nas-db --file=schema.sql
   ```

5. **Run locally:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   On first run, visit the login page and you'll be prompted to create your admin account.

6. **Deploy:**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```
